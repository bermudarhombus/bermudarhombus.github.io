    <h2><center>Balloon Payload Program</center></h2>
    <p class = "main"><center>Tony is a member of the Univeristy of Maryland Balloon Payload Program (BPP), a student-run club that launches high altitude weather balloons carrying various payloads. He is currently the project lead on a payload called PTERODACTYL, a sensor suite planned to launch during the October 2023 and April 2024 solar eclipse. Additionally, he helps out on the launchpad during launches with inflating the balloons from high-pressure helium tanks.</center></p>
    
    <h2><center>UMD Collective Dynamics and Control Laboratory</center></h2>
    <p class = "main"><center>Tony is currently working on using computer vision to provide real-time guidance and tracking information to allow 2 robotic fish to swim in formation, syncing their motion to give hydrodynamic benefits to the follower fish through a technique that real fish use called vortex phase matching.</center></p>
