            <td>I am a sophomore studying aerospace engineering at the University of Maryland: College Park. Ever since 
                watching footage of the moon landing as a kid, I've always been fascinated by aerospace.
                As I grew up I became more and more involved in stem, first through programming classes in elementary school
                and eventually through FIRST Robotics in high school. <br><br>
                Since reaching arriving at the University of Maryland, he has been active in a variety of both STEM and 
                non-STEM activities, including the UMD Balloon Payload Program, on campus research with the 
                Collective Dynamics and Control Laboratory, and juggling club.<br><br>
                His current research focuses on applying computer vision and AI to complex aerospace problems. Additionally,
                he is interested in the application of human factors engineering to aerospace systems and electric propulsion
                research.</th>

            <td><center>Over the summer of 2023, I worked on using computer vision to provide real-time guidance and tracking information to allow 2 robotic fish to swim in formation, syncing their motion to give hydrodynamic benefits to the follower fish through a technique that real fish use called vortex phase matching. Vortex phase matching is something live fish in schools do, by positioning themselves precisely with respect to the other fish in their swarm, they're able to take advantage of the 
                vortexes coming off of the surrounding fish, reducing drag and therefore reducing energy spent to move a given distance. It's already been shown that this is possible for robotic fish, so the challenge is getting the fish to actually move in the right formation. Using 2 fish held one behind the other, this requires not only knowing the distance from the front fish to the rear, but for the rear fish to know how fast the leader fish is
                flapping, along with a phase shift from a zero point in time of the leader's flapping so that the follower can synchronize its movement with the leader. We used a monocular camera on the follower fish to do this, which is what my work has been on. I wrote the computer vision software using OpenCV in Python to get these guidance parameters. With the follower fish flapping on a duty cycle
                (it would coast and record video for one second, then flap for one second), this process was able to accurately find frequency of the leader fish to within 0.1 hz
                (error could be improved with a longer recording window, but then the follower could not keep up with the leader), find phase shift accurately, and find distance accurate to within 1cm at a range of 70cm when compared with an ultrasonic sensor providing ground truth data.
                recording video), and I'm still working on having it work with the follower constantly flapping so that it doesn't have to coast at all.

            <td><center>I am the payload lead on Pterodactyl, a payload sent to the UMD BPP by the Nationwide Eclipse Ballooning Project (NEBP). The NEBP is a country-wide NASA-supported project that has gathered over 70 teams to launch scientific balloons during the 2023 and 2024 solar eclipses. 
                Pterodactyl is a sensor suite designed by Montana State University that carries various atmospheric sensors (GPS, thermometer, accelerometer, magnetometer, and pressure sensor) with the goal of tracking atmospheric gravity waves across the country during the eclipse. </center></td>

            <td><center>I am currently redesigning the structure of our Command payload which houses our main method of tracking our balloon. It sends GPS tracking data over the Automated Packet Reporting System (APRS), an amateur radio protocol that uses recievers all across the country to collect packets from 
                devices and gather them onto publicly-available tracking websites like aprs.fi. The payload electronics are being redesigned, and in the process we as a club want to update the payload structure to be smaller, sturdier, and easier to maintain.</center></td>
